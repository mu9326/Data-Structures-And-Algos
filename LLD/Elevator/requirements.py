# The elevator system should consist of multiple elevators serving multiple floors.
# Each elevator should have a capacity limit and should not exceed it.
# Users should be able to request an elevator from any floor and select a destination floor.
# The elevator system should efficiently handle user requests and optimize the movement of elevators to minimize waiting time.
# The system should prioritize requests based on the direction of travel and the proximity of the elevators to the requested floor.
# The elevators should be able to handle multiple requests concurrently and process them in an optimal order.
# The system should ensure thread safety and prevent race conditions when multiple threads interact with the elevators.

# Functional Requirements:
# multiple elevators
# multiple floors
# User - makes requests from a floor and selects a destination floor
# prioritize requests based on direction and proximity
# Efficiently handle user requests
# Optimize movement to minimize waiting time
# concurrent request handling

# Non-functional Requirements:
# thread safety and prevent race conditions
